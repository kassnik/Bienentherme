This file is based on the Dockerfile by Josip Janzic. Next commits will integrates the Volumes and the functionality of the Bienentherme.
Aim is to realize a Ready2Go Docker image that will realize the whole Functionality of the Bienentherme on the fly.
Then every Raspberry Pi 3 owner should be able to run the Bienentherme on his fresh Raspberry Pi III directly with one command after installing Docker on his system and adapting the hardware like the camera and prefered sensors.
